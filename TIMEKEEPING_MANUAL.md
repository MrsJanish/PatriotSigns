# Employee Guide: "Clocking In" to Jobs
The goal is simple: **Select the Job -> Hit Start -> Do Work -> Hit Stop.**

## The "Timer" Method (Recommended)
This is exactly like a punch clock, but for specific jobs.

### On Mobile (Shop/Installers)
1.  Open the **App**.
2.  Navigate to the **Task** (e.g., "Production - Main St Signage").
    *   *Tip:* You can search for the job number (e.g. "1002").
3.  Tap the big **Green "play" icon** or **"Start"** button.
    *   *The clock is now running.*
4.  Do your work.
5.  When finished (or switching jobs), tap **"Stop"**.
    *   The time is automatically saved to the Project.

### On Desktop (Office/Design)
1.  Open the **Task**.
2.  Look for the **"Start"** button in the top header.
3.  Click **Start**.
    *   You will see a red *Running* timer at the top of your screen.
    *   You can navigate away and do other Odoo work; it keeps running.
4.  Click **Stop** when you switch tasks or go to lunch.

## Method 2: Bulk Entry (End of Day)
(Only use this if you forgot to run the timer)

1.  Open **Timesheets**.
2.  Click **Add a Line**.
3.  Type: `Project`, `Task`, `Hours`.
